Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyonc\\u00e9's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \\\"Crazy in Love\\\" and \\\"Baby Boy\\\".\",\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 269,\n","              \"text\": \"in the late 1990s\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56be85543aeaaa14008c9063\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"When did Beyonce start becoming popular?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 207,\n","              \"text\": \"singing and dancing\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56be85543aeaaa14008c9065\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What areas did Beyonce compete in when she was growing up?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 526,\n","              \"text\": \"2003\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56be85543aeaaa14008c9066\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"When did Beyonce leave Destiny's Child and become a solo singer?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 166,\n","              \"text\": \"Houston, Texas\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bf6b0f3aeaaa14008c9601\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"In what city and state did Beyonce  grow up?

Beyonc\\u00e9 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am...

They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\",\n","

After the release of Dangerously in Love, Beyonc\\u00e9 had planned to produce a follow-up album using several of the left-over tracks. However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.

The album formally introduces Beyonc\\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\\"Crazy in Love\\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\" and the top-five songs \\\"If I Were a Boy\\\" and \\\"Halo\\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\\"Halo\\\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\\"Sweet Dreams\\\", and singles \\\"Diva\\\", \\\"Ego\\\", \\\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\\" and \\\"Video Phone\\\". The music video for \\\"Single Ladies\\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\\"first major dance craze\\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \\\"You Belong with Me\\\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech. In March 2009, Beyonc\\u00e9 embarked on the I Am... World Tour, her second headlining worldwide concert tour, consisting of 108 shows, grossing $119.5 million.\",\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","

The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, giving Beyonc\\u00e9 her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US. This made her the first woman in the chart's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one. Beyonc\\u00e9 received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days; The New York Times noted the album's unconventional, unexpected release as significant. Musically an electro-R&B album, it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work, such as \\\"bulimia, postnatal depression [and] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood\\\". The single \\\"Drunk in Love\\\", featuring Jay Z, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In April 2014, after much speculation in the weeks before, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour. It served as the couple's first co-headlining stadium tour together. On August 24, 2014, she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards.

They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009 and ninth on the \\\"Most Powerful Women in the World\\\" list in 2010. The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \\\"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\\\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals. In the same year, Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay Z placed at number one on the \\\"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\\\", for collectively earning $78 million. The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \\\"highest-earning power couple\\\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009. For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\\u00e9 earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012. In 2013, Beyonc\\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.

Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail calls Beyonc\\u00e9's voice \\\"versatile\\\", capable of exploring power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic flourishes, and hip hop. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonc\\u00e9's strange rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore

around 8 million copies. The music video for \\\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography and its deployment of jazz hands, was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \\\"first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\\\", triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube. In 2013, Drake released a single titled \\\"Girls Love Beyonc\\u00e9\\\", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \\\"Say My Name\\\" and discussed his relationship with women. In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyonc\\u00e9 due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen. In July 2014, a Beyonc\\u00e9 exhibit was introduced into the \\\"Legends of Rock\\\" section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\",\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 3,\n","              \"text\": \"March 30, 2015\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bed2993aeaaa14008c94c9\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"When was it discovered Beyonce was a co-owner of the music service, Tidal?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 230,\n","              \"text\": \"Jay Z\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bed2993aeaaa14008c94cb\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"The parent company of Tidal became under the ownership of whom in 2015?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 3,\n","              \"text\": \"March 30, 2015\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe0a9a10cfb140055135f\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"When was it announced that Beyonce was  a co-owner in Tidal?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 105,\n","              \"text\": \"music streaming service\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe0a9a10cfb1400551361\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What kind of service is Tidal?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 763,\n","              \"text\": \"low payout of royalties\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfe0a9a10cfb1400551363\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What is a criticism of other streaming services?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 129,\n","              \"text\": \"Tidal.\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f63e2ccc5a1400d8338a\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What music streaming system is Beyonc\\u00e9 part owner of?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 274,\n","              \"text\": \"Aspiro\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f63e2ccc5a1400d8338c\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What is the parent company of the music service Beyonc\\u00e9 owns part of?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 230,\n","              \"text\": \"Jay Z\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f63e2ccc5a1400d8338d\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"Who acquired the parent company of the music service Beyonc\\u00e9 owns part of?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 717,\n","              \"text\": \"Spotify\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f63e2ccc5a1400d8338e\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What music service is accused of providing low royalty amounts?\"\n","        }\n","      ]\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"context\": \"Beyonc\\u00e9 and her mother introduced House of Der\\u00e9on, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.

Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyonc\\u00e9 released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \\\"God Bless the USA\\\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.\",\n","      \"qas\": [\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 24,\n","              \"text\": \"George Clooney and Wyclef Jean\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bed4c23aeaaa14008c94ed\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"Who did Beyonce participate with in the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 356,\n","              \"text\": \"Brooklyn Phoenix House\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bed4c23aeaaa14008c94ee\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"Beyonce opened a cosmetology center in what location?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 781,\n","              \"text\": \"God Bless the USA\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bed4c23aeaaa14008c94ef\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"After Osama Bin Laden's death, what single did Beyonce cover?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 253,\n","              \"text\": \"$1 million\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfeb09a10cfb1400551391\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"How much did the T-shirt with Beyonce's image on it make? \"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 322,\n","              \"text\": \"Beyonc\\u00e9 Cosmetology Center at the Brooklyn Phoenix House\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfeb09a10cfb1400551392\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What enterprise did Beyonce and her mother start on March 5, 2010?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 849,\n","              \"text\": \"New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfeb09a10cfb1400551394\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What charity benefited from  the release of the song, God Bless the USA?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 57,\n","              \"text\": \"Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56bfeb09a10cfb1400551395\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What did she participate in with George Clooney?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 24,\n","              \"text\": \"George Clooney and Wyclef Jean\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f9112ccc5a1400d833b6\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"Which two stars did Beyonc\\u00e9 help with their Haiti Earthquake organization?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 322,\n","              \"text\": \"Beyonc\\u00e9 Cosmetology Center\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f9112ccc5a1400d833b7\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What did Beyonc\\u00e9 open at the Brooklyn Phoenix House in 2010?\"\n","        },\n","        {\n","          \"answers\": [\n","            {\n","              \"answer_start\": 781,\n","              \"text\": \"God Bless the USA\"\n","            }\n","          ],\n","          \"id\": \"56d4f9112ccc5a1400d833ba\",\n","          \"is_impossible\": false,\n","          \"question\": \"What Lee Greenwood song did Beyonc\\u00e9 cover after Osama bin Laden was killed?\"\n","        }\n","      ]\n","    },\n","    {\n","      \"context\": \"In December, Beyonc\\u00e9 along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \\\"Demand A Plan\\\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyonc\\u00e9 became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \\\"I Was Here\\\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\\u00e9 would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \\\"Chime for Change\\\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyonc\\u00e9 said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \\\"finding the best qualities in every human being.\\\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyonc\\u00e9 is also taking part in \\\"Miss a Meal\\\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout
