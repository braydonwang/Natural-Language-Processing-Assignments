## How To Use

#### Imports

To run the notebook, you must download the .ipynb file and upload it onto Google Colab. Then download all of the imports in the imports folder. On the notebook, upload the downloaded import files to the session storage (click the files icon on the left menu and then click the first icon from the left)
