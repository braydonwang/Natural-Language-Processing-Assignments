## Description

A list of all of my assignments that I developed during phase 2 of the GDG Cloud Edmonton Machine Learning Bootcamp 2021. All were made using python on Google Colab and relied heavily on Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and other libraries.

#### Language

- Python

#### Libraries

- nltk
- Collections
- Utils
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- and more...

## How To Use

#### Version

Make sure the nltk library is on version 3.5 to ensure all the values and output are correct!

Run this line of code at the beginning of the notebook to install:

```
!pip install nltk==3.5
```

Run this to make sure that it is the correct version:

```
nltk.__version__
```

#### Imports

To run the notebook, you must download the .ipynb file and upload it onto Google Colab. Then download all of the imports in the imports folder. On the notebook, upload the downloaded import files to the session storage (click the files icon on the left menu and then click the first icon from the left)
